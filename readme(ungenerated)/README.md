# Prof Readme

## Description

   I was motivated to create a command line application to showcase new acquired node.js skills.  I built it to show the power of the command line to create without a frontend UI.  It solves the problem of creating a professional readme with a simple to use, auto-formatting template.  I learnt how to pass parameters and functions between multiple scripts.  How to combine parameters to get tailored results.
